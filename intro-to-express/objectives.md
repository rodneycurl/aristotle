#Introduction to Express

* What is a framework? How is it different from a library?
Frameworks are code that someone wrote that we can use in our application. The most important difference, and in fact the defining difference between a library and a framework is Inversion of Control.

Which means that when you call a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you. (This is called the Hollywood Principle: Don't call Us, We'll call You.) If it doesn't have Inversion of Control, it's not a framework.

* What is Express?
Express is a web development framework.

* Why are we using Express?
Is the most popular node.JS framework. Also, because there is a lot of tutorials. Express is also a lightweight framework. Note: Rails is a heavyweight framework, meaning it does a lot more of the work for you up front.
