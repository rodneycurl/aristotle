Aristotle serves as a platform where I will continue to learn and practice the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Backend Basics, Node JS, Server Side Frameworks, Express, API's, Databases, RESTful Routing, Authentication, and Deployment post General Assembly to continue my development education.

"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." â€” Aristotle
